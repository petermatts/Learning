# Cyrpto with C++

Much like the Java folder in the Crypto-Research directory, this folder contains basic crypto currency code based off of my learning and personal ideas on how crypto is implemented. There is also a subfolder for cyrptographic hashing algorithms and bitwise operations.

However, this colder contains all of this in a different language. C++! which is a new programming language to me, but this is how I learn, by practicing while also learning new concepts and materials :)
