# Learning

This repository is a compilation of all my self learning projects to better improve my skills as a computer scientist.

## LearningC-Cpp

Storage for my code taking the C/C++specialization on Coursera taught by Ira Pohl. I took this in preparation for a lower level operating systems course during my undergrad.

## CUDA

This is my attempt at learning CUDA from the book [CUDA By Example](https://edoras.sdsu.edu/~mthomas/docs/cuda/cuda_by_example.book.pdf).

All code here is code that I have replicated from the book for my own understanding, as well as any additional programs I write to better understand CUDA.

### Compiling and running

Compile with `nvcc <filename>`

Generates 3 files (by default):
- `a.exe` run this file
- `a.exp`
- `a.lib`

Handy compiler flags:
- `-o` specify name of output file
- `-odir` specify name of output directory
- `-I` include path
- `-g` host/CPU debug
- `-G` device/GPU debug

## CMake

New learning project where I attempt to learn the CMake tool.

## Graphviz

Some code and notes I have on learning to use the Graphviz tool and the `dot` language.

## FunJavaStuff

This folder isn't so much a learning folder but it is some Java code I played around with in my free time a long time ago when I was not familiar with other languages that could probably handle these tasks even better.

## Crypto

### C++ Folder

This folder is dedicated to my work with crytopgraphy and cryptocurrenceis in C++

**Note:** This is my first time working with C++ and exanding my knowledge of programming languages

### Java Folder

This folder is dedicated to my work with crytopgraphy and cryptocurrenceis in Java.
As of this moment, this is the most developed folder as Java is my strongest programming language, so I am starting my research in java and then plan to migrate and implement similar work in other languages like C++ above.

For in depth detail of the contents of this folder please view the README withing the `Java` folder.

### Truffle Folder

This folder contains my work with ERC20 Token design and my learning of Eutherium's language solidity.

Within this folder there are 2 project folders, a default truffle example project example `MetaCoin` and my own project that I have been creating `PyramidCoin` with reference to the solidity docs and `MetaCoin`.

### Slideshow

I made a breif google slides that aims to explain the basis of how cryptocurrency works.

### About

This repository contains the programming and technical parts of my personal/self-assigneed research project into cyrptography and cryptocurrenceis.
